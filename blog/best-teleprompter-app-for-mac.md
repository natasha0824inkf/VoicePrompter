I've tried a lot of Mac teleprompter apps. More than I'd like to admit. Before I built my own, I spent a genuinely embarrassing amount of time testing everything I could find on the App Store and beyond.

This is not a sponsored roundup. I'm not going to pretend I use five different apps simultaneously. I'm going to tell you what the options actually are, what they're good for, what they're missing, and where [VoicePrompter for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6758573080?pt=128503212&ct=vp-blog&mt=8) sits in that landscape.

## What Makes a Good Mac Teleprompter

Before comparing anything, let me be specific about what actually matters for a Mac-based workflow.

**It needs to stay on top.** Not just on top of other apps — on top of full-screen apps. On top of Keynote in presentation mode. On top of full-screen Zoom. If the teleprompter disappears when you go full-screen in any app, it's unusable for the most common recording scenarios.

**It should be invisible to screen recording.** If you're recording a demo, webinar, tutorial, or screen share and the teleprompter appears in the recording — that's a hard fail. The whole point is that it's for you, not your viewers.

**Voice scrolling should actually work.** Not auto-scroll, not manual scroll — voice activated, where the text tracks your speech, pauses when you pause, and resumes when you speak. This is harder to get right than it sounds, and most apps don't get it right.

**Language support should be realistic.** If you speak anything other than English, or if you work with multilingual teams, you need real multi-language support, not a dropdown of 5 languages where only English actually performs well.

## The Landscape

### VoicePrompter for Mac

This is the one I built. I'm biased — obviously — but I can also tell you exactly what it does.

[VoicePrompter for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6758573080?pt=128503212&ct=vp-blog&mt=8) is a native macOS app that runs as a menu bar app. The window is a transparent overlay that:

- Stays on top of all apps and all full-screen modes
- Is completely invisible in Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, OBS, and QuickTime screen recordings
- Uses Apple's native on-device speech recognition (private, works offline)
- Supports 60+ languages with automatic language detection
- Can be loaded instantly from clipboard or launched via macOS Services from any text editor

The voice scrolling algorithm is custom-built and is genuinely better than most things I've tested. I know that sounds like something anyone would say about their own product, but I built it specifically because I couldn't find anything that worked reliably, and getting the algorithm right was the hardest part of the whole project. If you want details, I go into it in [why all teleprompter apps suck](./why-all-teleprompter-apps-suck.md).

The app is 2 megabytes. It launches instantly. Pricing is $3.99/month or $39.99/year. There's a free tier with unlimited demo script usage and 3 custom script slots.

### Teleprompter Pro

A solid option with a clean interface. Available on Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Good sync between devices if you're in that ecosystem.

The main limitations: voice scrolling is available but less precise than native speech recognition apps. The window can be configured to stay on top but it is visible in screen recordings, which is a significant problem for demo and webinar use cases.

### Vodium

Specifically positioned for business presentations and video calls. Has adjustable transparency and decent overlay functionality.

It works, but it's more expensive and doesn't handle the screen-capture-invisible use case. If you're doing a screen share and someone sees a text overlay in the corner of your video, that's awkward.

### Promptsmart Pro

Uses voice recognition for scrolling. The recognition tech is decent for English but falls off noticeably for other languages. On Mac specifically, the app feels like an iPad app that was ported rather than something designed for macOS natively.

### Browser-Based Options

[VoicePrompter web app](https://voiceprompter.app) also works on Mac via browser or as an installed PWA. It's free and open source. The voice scrolling works, mirror mode works, it's offline capable.

The web app doesn't have the always-on-top functionality or the screen-capture-invisible feature — those require native OS integration. But if you don't need those features, the web app at [voiceprompter.app](https://voiceprompter.app) is the best free option and is perfectly functional for non-screen-share recording scenarios.

## Which One Should You Use

If you record demos, webinars, tutorials, online presentations, podcasts, or do sales calls over video — and you do any of these on a Mac — you want [VoicePrompter for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6758573080?pt=128503212&ct=vp-blog&mt=8). The combination of invisible overlay and always-on-top with reliable voice scrolling is the specific set of features that solves the actual problem.

If you only film yourself with a camera (not screen recording), and you want a completely free solution, the web app at [voiceprompter.app](https://voiceprompter.app) is excellent and costs nothing.

If you specifically need iPad/iPhone sync as a primary feature, Teleprompter Pro is worth looking at.

## The Screen Capture Invisible Feature — Why It Matters More Than You Think

I want to spend a moment on this because it's the feature that gets underappreciated until the moment you need it.

Imagine you're doing a sales call over Zoom. You have a tight script — opening, qualification questions, demo flow, pricing, close. You've rehearsed it. You want to reference it during the call without looking obviously at notes.

With a regular teleprompter window, you have two problems. First, if you share your screen at any point, the teleprompter text appears in the share. Second, even if you don't share your screen, the window is visually cluttered in your taskbar, notification area, etc., and you're always one accidental app switch away from losing it.

With an invisible overlay that stays on top: the teleprompter is always there, always readable, visible only to you, and never appearing in recordings or screen shares. That's a qualitatively different experience. I explain the full setup for Zoom and similar tools in [teleprompter for Zoom — invisible overlay](./teleprompter-for-zoom-invisible.md).
